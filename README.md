# Fullstack project (WIP)

## Introduction
This is a course project for school. The topic given was a foreign language word practicing application for kids.  

## Features
The application has two user roles, admin and student.  
There are three languages supported, English, Finnish and Swedish.  

The admin can manage word pairs and tags by adding, editing and removing them. Wordpair can be e.g: Eng: "cat", Fin: "kissa", Swe: "katt", and a tag: "Animal"  
The student can practice the word pairs the admin created.  

The admin has the ability to determine tags for the word pairs (e.g., Eng: dog, Fin: koira, Swe: hund, Tags: animal).  
The student has two practice modes to choose from: either practice all words, or choose a tag and practice the filtered words.  
The student can choose which two of the three languages they want to practice, and choose the language they want to practice writing.  

## Screenshots:

## Cloud
The project is partly on the cloud, but due to some 'content security policy' and 'blocked cross origin requests', it doesn't function properly.  
The author left no time to solve said problem
